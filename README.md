# School Management System

A web-based School Management System built with Django, designed to manage users (students, teachers, guardians, supervisors), academic sections and levels, assignments, and provide a streamlined interface in Arabic (RTL) and LTR fields where needed.

## Features

- **Custom User Model**: Unifies multiple user types (student, teacher, guardian, supervisor) with phone number as username.
- **Role-Based Access**: Supervisors can add, edit, and delete students and academic records; each action shows real-time feedback messages (success or error) to the user.
- **Student Profiles**: One-to-one `StudentProfile` with section assignment, join date, added-by supervisor.
- **Academic Levels**: `Students_Academic_Levels` model linking students to academic levels, registration date, and a flag marking the current level.
- **CRUD Interfaces**:
  - Add, edit, delete supervisors and students.
  - Add, edit, delete academic level records per student.
- **Validation & Feedback**:
  - Inline field validation (unique phone/email, password strength).
  - Translated error messages in Arabic, RTL/LTR handling for email & phone inputs.
  - Prevent multiple "current" academic levels per student.
- **Search & Filters**: Django-filter integration for searching students and supervisors.
- **Internationalization**: Configured for Arabic (`ar`), with Djangoâ€™s built-in translations.
